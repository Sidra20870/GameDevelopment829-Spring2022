## Game Idea
### Sidra Usman
#### The Onion Person
I want to make a person, his body was made of onions who to find treasure and to climb up the stairs , he could fight from dragons, fire, aliens etc but in the magic part is stairs not stand in one place, it could be chnage the sight from up down left right and sometimes it can break, half of the move on up and half of the mive on down. He must to climb the stairs to pass the level. In this game we have multiple levels, scenarios and design towards low to hard.
My idea may lie in these aspects
-> Adventure
-> Fight
-> Strategy
-> Maybe first person and third person
