## Game Idea
### Sidra Usman
#### The Onion Person
I want to make a person, his body was made of onions who to find treasure and to climb up the stairs , he could fight from dragons, fire, aliens etc but in the magic part is stairs not stand in one place, it could be chnage the sight from up down left right and sometimes it can break, half of the move on up and half of the move on down. He must to climb the stairs to pass the level. In this game we have multiple levels, scenarios and design towards low to hard.
My idea may lie in these aspects
-> Adventure
-> Fight
-> Strategy
-> Maybe first person and third person
          
### Bushra Liaquat Khan
#### Virtual Reality Makeup Game:
As a makeup enthusiast, I always wanted to create a reality based scenarios in which a player can select to do either clients makeup or participate in various competitions for e.g. if user has reached a higher level then competiting in fashion shows and dealing with doing models makeup would be a task and a good experience to manage time. 
-> Time Management
-> Virtual Reality
-> Creativity
-> Adventure
-> Strategy

### Muhammad Saqlain
#### For Visually Impaired Or Blind Person
#### Visual Fighter
As a person who can not see the screen but hearing or feel anything which can play this game. In this game we have a Person which can collect a barbel letters which they can feel from touch sensor and if any enemy is far away 5cm or a mile away from them a beep sound can hear with the sentense like jump up, sit down, move fastly or slowly, shoot etc. Childs can learn a lot of words with enjoyment.
-> Fight
-> Strategy
-> Creativity
-> Scenes etc.
