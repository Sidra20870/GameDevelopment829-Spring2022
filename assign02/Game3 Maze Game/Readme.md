## 🗣️ELEVATOR PITCH
In this game we have a scenario like walls around the corners, we have a third person shooter that searches a path between these walls to complete the game and to arrive at the finish line from getting out of between these walls, simply that the person searches the path which he wants to go.
## 💵MONETIZATION:
Yes, we have a plan for the future to monetize a game that is we do App Ads between playing a game but we think it is a little bit annoying so we can make a purchase model like subscription for those users who have interest in playing a game. This monetization model often prevents users from downloading your game and gives you one-time revenue
## STORY:
The story of a maze game is that users have a third person character and have multiple paths which we make with glass walls. There is no big story in this game just to find the secret path between the glass walls.
## GAMEPLAY:
3D maze Game is a logic game that will help you to pass the time to find interesting and secret paths. A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from an entrance to a goal. 
#### Object of the game: 
The object of the game is to get your maze runner through your maze collecting the sprites (paths) before the clock runs out of time
