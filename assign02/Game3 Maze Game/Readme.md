## 🗣️ELEVATOR PITCH
In this game we have a scenario like walls around the corners, we have a third person shooter that searches a path between these walls to complete the game and to arrive at the finish line from getting out of between these walls, simply that the person searches the path which he wants to go.
## 💵MONETIZATION:
Yes, we have a plan for the future to monetize a game that is we do App Ads between playing a game but we think it is a little bit annoying so we can make a purchase model like subscription for those users who have interest in playing a game. This monetization model often prevents users from downloading your game and gives you one-time revenue
## STORY:
The story of a maze game is that users have a third person character and have multiple paths which we make with glass walls. There is no big story in this game just to find the secret path between the glass walls.
## GAMEPLAY:
3D maze Game is a logic game that will help you to pass the time to find interesting and secret paths. A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from an entrance to a goal. 
#### Object of the game: 
The object of the game is to get your maze runner through your maze collecting the sprites (paths) before the clock runs out of time
#### Target Goal:
A maze is a type of puzzle game where a player moves in complex and branched passages to find a particular target or location. 
## Features / Game Elements:
A maze is a structure surrounded by walls with numerous paths and passages, making it difficult for anyone to pass from one end of the maze to the other. Just like the actual maze, so we will develop a game which will have big walls as border to create confusion for the player.
1. First of all, you have to create the 3D plane on which the entire maze will reside.
2. Add materials and color to the game objects.
3. Add Third Person CHaracter and fit the camera with it
4. To add the walls (3D cubes), go to GameObject menu → 3D object → Cube.
5. Then add materials and texture on it.
6. Now adjust the size of the cube/wall according to your Character size (probably little bit larger than the size of the Character), increase the scale of Y coordinate or keeping Y coordinate intact, increase the X coordinate.
7. Design the maze structure by arranging the cubes on the 3D Plane, making the whole setup just like a maze.
8. We can use images & texture to make the maze walls and the 3D plane look more realistic.
9. You can download the wall texture (which is basically an image) and add it to the Assets pane by directly dragging the image from your desktop and dropping it onto any folder in the Asset pane.
10. Now, select that texture asset and drag it onto the walls to give your wall, a wall type look and the plane, a glassy feels.
11. Add Prefabs for what we doing multiple times.
12. Add sound features using download online sound in assets.
13. Add scripts for target the goal and move the character.
14. Add Animation in character.
15. Run the game using the play button.
