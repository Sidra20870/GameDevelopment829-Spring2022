## 🗣️ELEVATOR PITCH
In this game we have a scenario like walls around the corners, we have a third person shooter that searches a path between these walls to complete the game and to arrive at the finish line from getting out of between these walls, simply that the person searches the path which he wants to go.
## 💵MONETIZATION:
Yes, we have a plan for the future to monetize a game that is we do App Ads between playing a game but we think it is a little bit annoying so we can make a purchase model like subscription for those users who have interest in playing a game. This monetization model often prevents users from downloading your game and gives you one-time revenue
