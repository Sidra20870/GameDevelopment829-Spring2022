Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time. The goal of Sudoku is to fill a 9√ó9 grid with numbers so that each row, column and 3√ó3 section contain all of the digits between 1 and 9. As a logic puzzle, Sudoku is also an excellent brain game. If you play Sudoku daily, you will soon start to see improvements in your concentration and overall brain power.
## üíµMONETIZATION:
Yes, we have a plan for the future to monetize a game that is we do App Ads between playing a game but we think it is a little bit annoying so we can make a purchase model like subscription for those users who have interest in playing a game. This monetization model can use to generate revenue from a game product.
## GAMEPLAY:

#### Target Goal:
The goal of Sudoku is to fill in a 9√ó9 grid with digits so that each column, row, and 3√ó3 section contain the numbers between 1 to 9. At the beginning of the game, the 9√ó9 grid will have some of the squares filled in. Your job is to use logic to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid.
Don‚Äôt forget, a move is incorrect if:
- Any row contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9
- Any column contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9

## Features / Game Elements:
Sudoku is a fun puzzle game once you get the hang of it. At the same time, learning to play Sudoku can be a bit intimidating for beginners. So, if you are a complete beginner, here are a few Sudoku tips that you can use to improve your Sudoku skills.<br>

<b>Tip 1:</b> Look for rows, columns of 3√ó3 sections that contain 5 or more numbers. Work through the remaining empty cells, trying the numbers that have not been used. In many cases, you will find numbers that can only be placed in one position considering the other numbers that are already in its row, column, and 3√ó3 grid.<br>
  <b>Tip 2: </b> Break the grid up visually into 3 columns and 3 rows. Each large column will have 3, 3√ó3 grids and each row will have 3, 3√ó3 grids. Now, look for columns or grids that have 2 of the same number. Logically, there must be a 3rd copy of the same number in the only remaining 9-cell section. Look at each of the remaining 9 positions and see if you can find the location of the missing number.
